### Project Start & End Date
* Jan 2017 – June 2019

### Channel of Collaboration and/or Funding
* SIT Ignition Grant
* Integrative Team Project (ITP)

### Problem to Solve
* Polyclinics are planning the duty schedule of their staff and nurses manually based on the knowledge of planners.
* The competency and availability of the staff are collated manually and preference of staff cannot be easily satisfied

### Solution and Notable Contribution
* Develop an automated staff roster planning system that generates staff duty schedule and assigns staff to workstations fairly based on their competency, availability and preference and the business rules of different polyclinics.

### Notable Outcome(s) / Progress and Next Step / Potential of Wider Application
* The Training Record Management System (TRMS), Leave Projection System (LPS) and Staff Roster Planning system (SRPS) have been deployed for use in the NHGP polyclinics.
